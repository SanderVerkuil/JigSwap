## Key Platform Concepts

### Personal Library Management
The platform serves as your personal puzzle library where you can:
- Track your complete puzzle collection
- Record multiple completions of the same puzzle
- Maintain detailed completion history with timing, ratings, and personal reviews
- Analyze your solving patterns and progress over time
- Organize puzzles with custom categories and visibility levels

### Puzzle Visibility Levels
Each puzzle in your collection can be set to one of five visibility levels:
- **Private**: Only visible to you
- **Visible**: Publicly viewable but not available for exchange
- **Lendable**: Available for temporary borrowing with return agreement
- **Swappable**: Available for permanent swaps with other puzzles
- **Tradeable**: Available for sale or auction

### Exchange System with History Preservation
The platform's exchange system is designed to preserve your personal history:
- When you trade a puzzle, your completion history remains intact
- New puzzle instances are created for new owners
- Complete ownership history is tracked for each puzzle instance
- You can see the entire chain of custody for any puzzle
- Condition tracking is maintained through all exchanges
