## 🏠 Our Story

JigSwap began as a family side project in 2024. We were tired of constantly asking friends and family "What puzzles do you have?" and wanted an easy way to see and exchange puzzles within our circle. What started as a simple solution for our puzzle-loving family has grown into a platform that serves the broader puzzle community.

Our mission is to make puzzle sharing sustainable, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone - whether you're trading with family members or connecting with fellow enthusiasts worldwide.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SanderVerkuil/jigswap.git
   cd jigswap
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   This project uses a monorepo structure with Nx workspace:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:

   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local

   Fill in the required environment variables in `apps/web/.env.local`:
   - Get Convex URL by running the backend setup (step 4)
   - Get Clerk keys from your [Clerk dashboard](https://clerk.com)
   - Crowdin settings are optional for translation contributions

4. **Set up Convex**

   ```bash
   cd packages/backend
   pnpm convex:dev
   ```

   This will:
   - Create a new Convex project (if needed)
   - Deploy your schema and functions
   - Start the development server

5. **Start the development server**
   In a separate terminal, from the root directory:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
